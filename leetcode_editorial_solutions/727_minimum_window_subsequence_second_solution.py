Approach #2: Dynamic Programming (Next Array Variation) [Accepted]
Intuition

Let's guess that the minimum window will start at S[i]. We can assume that S[i] = T[0]. Then, we should find the next occurrence of T[1] in S[i+1:], say at S[j]. Then, we should find the next occurrence of T[2] in S[j+1:], and so on.

Finding the next occurrence can be precomputed in linear time so that each guess becomes O(T)O(T) work.

Algorithm

We can precompute (for each i and letter), next[i][letter]: the index of the first occurrence of letter in S[i:], or -1 if it is not found.

Then, we'll maintain a set of minimum windows for T[:j] as j increases. At the end, we'll take the best minimum window.
